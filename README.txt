This plugin provides realtime data reporting for free downloads and form-based requests from our website.

== Description ==

The P4P Stats plugin was created to keep you out of the backend database! 
To make this happen, I'm hoping to capture all of the questions you have for the database and provide a simple interface to see those.

One of the key features is the ability to export the data as CSV. This make it universally acceptable for Excel, Google Sheets, etc.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `p4p-stats.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_p4p_stats'); ?>` in your templates

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
